# Class Webpage Portfolio! üê∑‚ú®

Welcome to the repository for my super adorable webpage created for my **CISC 3610** class! üíñ This page is a fun hub where I showcase all the cool projects and homework assignments I've been working on. It features a friendly animations, pastel colors, and lots of cute details! The goal was to create a delightful and easy-to-navigate space to present my work. I focused on a "cutesy" aesthetic with a consistent theme, using specific fonts, color palettes, and adorable  graphics!

I wanted a page that was not only functional but also brought a little bit of joy to anyone visiting!
