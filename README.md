# Keira's Awesome Class Webpage Portfolio! 🐷✨

Welcome to the repository for my super adorable webpage created for my **[Your Class Name/Number]** class! 💖 This page is a fun, cutesy hub where I showcase all the cool projects and homework assignments I've been working on. It features a friendly animated piggy, pastel colors, and lots of cute details!

## About The Project 🎀

This webpage serves as my personal portfolio for the coursework in **[Your Class Name/Number]**. The goal was to create a delightful and easy-to-navigate space to present my work. I focused on a "cutesy" aesthetic with a consistent theme, using specific fonts, color palettes, and adorable piggy graphics! 🐷🌷

I wanted a page that was not only functional but also brought a little bit of joy to anyone visiting!

## Features 🌟

*   **🐷 Animated Header:** A welcoming header featuring an animated piggy waving hello!
*   **🎨 Cutesy Design:** Consistent use of pastel colors (`#FFF0F5` lavender blush, pinks), rounded elements, and playful fonts (`Gaegu` and `Kalam`).
*   **🌟 My Projects Section:** A beautifully styled list of links to my main class projects, each with a cute piggy icon.
*   **📚 My Homework Section:** A dedicated area for links to my homework assignments, maintaining the overall charming theme.
*   **💻 GitHub Link Box:** A prominent, specially styled button in a darker pink, inviting visitors to check out my GitHub profile.
*   **✨ Dynamic Footer:** The copyright year in the footer updates automatically using a tiny bit of JavaScript.
*   **📱 Responsive (ish!):** While not fully Bootstrap-ified *yet*, it's designed to be pleasant on various screen sizes. *(You can adjust this point based on how responsive it actually is)*
